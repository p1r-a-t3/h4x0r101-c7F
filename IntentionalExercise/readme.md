# Intentional Exercise

## Steps

[After de-compiling using apktool]

Theres only one activity and the flag seems to be hidden behind a webview. URL is plain and visible on the source code. Need to recreate a portions of MainActivity to understand what happened there and backtrack where I need to go!

There is also some sort of secret key for SHA-256. I don't know why it is tho!
